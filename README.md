# Parallel-Programming

## Overview
This repo is all about making things run faster using multi-threading, SIMD, and OpenMP. Whether itâ€™s crunching numbers, searching through strings, or optimizing graph algorithms, everything here is built to leverage parallelism and squeeze out extra performance.
## Contents

### [Formulas](./formulas)
Optimized implementations of mathematical formulas using **SIMD intrinsics** and **Assembly** for high-performance numerical computations.

### [Strings](./strings)
Efficient implementations of **Base64 Distance** and **Hamming Distance** using **SIMD and Assembly** to speed up string processing.

### [Parallel Linked List](./linked_list)
A **thread-safe linked list** implementation using **OpenMP locks**, allowing concurrent insertions, deletions, and searches.

### [Parallel Algorithms](./parallelAlgorithms)
Pseudocode implementations of various **parallel algorithms**, including **Bitonic Merge, Odd-Even Merge, and Parallel DFS**.

### [omp](./omp)
A collection of **notes and insights** on writing efficient parallel programs using **OpenMP**.

### [Parallel BFS](./parallelBFS)
A **multi-threaded Breadth-First Search (BFS)** using **Task Queues and a Thread Pool**, designed for efficient graph traversal.

##

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with more details on the implementation.
